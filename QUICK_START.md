# Quick Start Guide for Fixed Implementation

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Setup)

### 1. Immediate Training Test
```bash
# Activate environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate environment (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Test training with small dataset
python train.py --batch_size 4 --num_epochs 2 --no_wandb
```

### 2. Quick Prediction Test
```bash
# Test prediction on a sample image
python predict.py path/to/sample_image.jpg --model_path checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

### 3. Verify All Fixes

#### ✅ Size Mismatch Fix Verification
The error `ValueError: Target size (torch.Size([1, 6, 512, 512])) must be the same as input size (torch.Size([1, 6, 1024, 1024]))` is now fixed by:

- Automatic interpolation in segmentation head
- Consistent tensor dimensions throughout pipeline
- Proper size matching in loss calculation

#### ✅ Gating Logging Fix Verification  
Training now shows gating information:
```
Gating Stats - Cls Gate: 0.523 ± 0.142
Gating Stats - Seg Gate: 0.477 ± 0.138
```

#### ✅ Prediction Script Fix Verification
The `predict.py` script now provides:
- Terminal output with gating values and scores
- Automatic saving to `runs/` folder
- Segmentation mask generation and saving
- Comprehensive visualization

## 🔧 Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Train.py

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: Import Errors
```bash
# Ensure you're in the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Issue 2: CUDA Memory Issues  
```python
# In config.py, reduce batch size
self.batch_size = 4  # Instead of 8
```

### Issue 3: Dataset Not Found
```bash
# Verify dataset structure matches DATASET_SETUP.md
# Ensure correct folder names and file extensions
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### For Faster Training:
```python
# In config.py
self.mixed_precision = True      # Enable mixed precision
self.num_workers = 4            # Adjust based on your CPU cores
self.pin_memory = True          # Keep enabled for GPU training
```

### For Better Results:
```python
# In config.py  
self.use_augmentation = True    # Enable data augmentation
self.batch_size = 16           # Increase if you have enough memory
self.learning_rate = 5e-4      # Try different learning rates
```
